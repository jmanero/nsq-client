NSQ Client for Node.JS
======================
A simple implementation of the NSQ-V2 protocol using native Buffer objects,
based entirely upon the protocol documentation found in
[Bitly's GitHub project](https://github.com/bitly/nsq/blob/master/docs/protocol.md).

### Connection
_A single TCP connection to a single `nsqd` instance_

    var NSQ = require('nsq-client');
    var Client = NSQ.Connection
    var Message = NSQ.Message;
    
    var Util = require('util');
    
    var c = Client.connect(<hostname>[, <port>]); // Defaults to port 4150
    
    // Optional callback...
    c.subscribe("foo", "bar", function(err, sub) {
    	if(err)
    	    throw err;
        
        sub.on('message', function(message) {
            ...
            message.finish(); // or .requeue(), or .touch()
        });
    });
    
    c.publish(new Message({ some : "JSON-serializable Object/string/whatever"}), "foo")
    
    // c.close();
    

### Clustered Client
Removed until it can be refactored to use the updated `connection` API

### TODO
 * `IDENTIFY`
 * `MPUB` operation
 * ~~Atomic request-response handling~~ _v0.1.0_
 * Use `lookupd` more better. Differentiate between producer and consumer modes when
 connecting. Possibly split `Topic` into separate prototypes to that end...
 * Implement socket-failure tolerance in `Connection`. Figure out how to reconnect
 intelligently to an available `nsqd`

### Notes
 * These docs are (clearly) far from complete. I'm happy to consider pull requests from anyone who would like to
 contribute to them; or to anything in this repo for that matter...
 * In general, methods exposed by instantiated `Connection` objects accept a callback. ~~At this time, execution of said
 callbacks only indicates that the underlying NSQ message was flushed from the buffer of the client TCP socket, or an
 input error (e.g. bad topic or channel string) occurred and no message was sent. Start with the
 [NodeJS net.Socket](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.8.19/api/net.html#net_socket_write_data_encoding_callback) documentation
 for insight into the behavior of the `Socket.write()` method~~. _v0.1.0_
 * Correlation of requests and errors is somewhat difficult due to the asynchronous nature of the NSQ TCP protocol.
 For now, `Connection` objects just emit `error` events when `error`-type frames are received. I'm open to suggestions
 as to a reliable way to bubble errors back up to the correct callback...
  * UPDATE: As more documentation is being made available, it appears that the protocol expects only one message to be
  send at a time, and will send an atomic response. Added to TODO...
